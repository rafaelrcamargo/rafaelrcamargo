> An inventive student of technology & computers.

### 📝 This is where I keep my projects. Feel free to learn more:

I enjoy solving problems and learning new things, tools, languages, and more. I learn as needed, and I'm always searching for a new excuse to write in {trending_coding_language}.

- 📚 I'm currently working with **⚛ React Native | Next.js** & **Node.js | Prisma | tRPC** with **TypeScript**.
- 🌱 I'm a lifelong learner, and nothing bugs me more than not understanding something. Right now, I'm diving deep into math, scaling architecture, and language performance.
- 🎉 In my free time, I enjoy:
  - Coding in **Rust**. It's all about safety, performance, and the best developer experience out there, besides being cool.
  - Sketching in **Python** from plots to an [automated YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@trendinggoesbrrr) and whatever else I'm feeling like... 👀
  - Oh and **Haskell**, the language that's as complex as a Rubik's cube, as beautiful as a sunset, and as elusive as a unicorn. _(I'm also not really sure where I would use it, but using it as a reference sounds really cool...)_
- 💬 I also create IoT projects with **Arduino** & **C/C++**, and overall *IOT stuff*! Maybe they will blow your mind, maybe your fuse...

> **Note**: I've separated my favorite projects and pinned them down below. Give them a look!
