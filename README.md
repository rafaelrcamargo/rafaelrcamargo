## hi!

> swe [@clerk](https://clerk.com/) & hobbyist open-source developer

- currently working with Next.js, TypeScript, React Query, Playwright, and the list goes on...
- thinking about how fe should scale, where the server fits in, and then how it all should interact, way more than I should
- diving deep into scalable patterns for modern front-end platforms, streaming, serverless, and the [React Server](https://github.com/rafaelrcamargo/r19) model
- in my free time, I enjoy:
  - messing with **Rust**'s borrow checker ðŸ‘€. it's all about [safety](https://github.com/rafaelrcamargo/cout), [performance](https://github.com/rafaelrcamargo/quix), and the [best developer experience](https://github.com/rafaelrcamargo/ds) out there
  - creating sketches in Python or [Mojo](https://github.com/rafaelrcamargo/aoc/tree/main/2022/06_mojo) ðŸ”¥, from plots to an [automated YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@trendinggoesbrrr) _(before it was everywhere, I swear ðŸ˜­)_, and whatever else I feel like, really...
  - participating in the **202X Advent of Code**, where I try a new programming language each day. [it's been fun](https://github.com/rafaelrcamargo/aoc)!
- I've also worked on IoT projects with **Arduino**s & **C++**. they might blow your mind, or your fuse... _(sorry about that ðŸ‘€)_
