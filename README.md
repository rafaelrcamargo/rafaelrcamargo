> A inventive student of technology & computers.

### 📝 This is the place where I save my projects, so feel free to learn more:

I like solving problems and learning new things, tools, languages, etc... I learn as needed. I'm also always searching for a new excuse for writing it in {trending_coding_language}. 

- 📚 I'm currently working with **⚛ React Native | Next.js** & **Node.js | Prisma | tRPC** with **TypeScript**.
- 🌱 I'm ever studying, and not understanding bothers me. Math, scaling architecture, and Lang. Perf. are the topics for now.
- 🎉 And for fun I like:
  - Coding in **Rust**, is all about safety, performance, and the best developer experience out there, besides being cool.
  - Sketching in **Python** from plots to an automated YouTube channel and whatever else I'm feeling like... 👀\_
  - Oh and **Haskell**, I'm searching for an excuse to learn it. :D
- 💬 I also have some projects with **Arduino** in **C/C++**, and general *IOT stuff* & love to talk about it!

> **Note**: I've separated my favorite projects, and pinned them down below, give it a look!
