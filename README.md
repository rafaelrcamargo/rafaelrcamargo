### 📝 This is where I keep my projects. Feel free to explore more:

I enjoy solving problems and learning new things, tools, languages, etc. I learn as needed, and I'm always looking for a new reason to code in `{{ trending_programming_language }}`.

- 📚 I'm currently working with **⚛ React, Next.js, Node.js & Serverless** using **AWS CDK w/ TypeScript**.
- 🌱 I'm a lifelong learner, and nothing annoys me more than not understanding something.
  - 📖 Currently, I'm delving deep into scalable architecture, serverless & [RSC](https://github.com/rafaelrcamargo/rsc).
- 🎉 In my free time, I enjoy:
  - Coding in 🦀 **Rust**. It's all about [safety](https://github.com/rafaelrcamargo/cout), [performance](https://github.com/rafaelrcamargo/quix), and the [best developer experience](https://github.com/rafaelrcamargo/ds) out there.
  - Creating sketches in **Python 🐍** (or [Mojo](https://github.com/rafaelrcamargo/aoc/tree/main/2022/06_mojo) 🔥), from plots to an [automated YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@trendinggoesbrrr), and whatever else I feel like... 👀
  - Oh, I'm also participating in the **202X Advent of Code**, and each day I use a new programming language. [It's been fun](https://github.com/rafaelrcamargo/aoc)!
- 💬 I've also worked on IoT projects with **Arduino** & **C++**! They might blow your mind, or your fuse... _(sory for that. 👀)_
