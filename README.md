> An inventive student of technology & computers.

### 📝 This is where I keep my projects. Feel free to explore more:

I enjoy solving problems and learning new things, tools, languages, and etc. I learn as needed, and I'm always looking for a new reason to code in `{{ trending_programming_language }}`.

- 📚 I'm currently working with **⚛ React, Next.js, Node.js & Serverless** using **AWS CDK w/ TypeScript**.
- 🌱 I'm a lifelong learner, and nothing annoys me more than not understanding something.
  - 📖 Currently, I'm delving deep into scalable architecture, serverless & IaC.
- 🎉 In my free time, I enjoy:
  - Coding in 🦀 **Rust**. It's all about safety, performance, and the best developer experience out there.
  - Creating sketches in **Python 🐍** (or Mojo 🔥), from plots to an [automated YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@trendinggoesbrrr), and whatever else I feel like... 👀
  - Oh, and I'm also participating in the **202X AOC** (Advent of Code), and for each day I choose a different programming language. It's been a fun journey!
- 💬 I also work on IoT projects with **Arduino** & **C++**! They might blow your mind, or maybe your fuse... _(sory for that. 👀)_

> **Note**: I've separated my favorite projects and pinned them below. Take a look!
