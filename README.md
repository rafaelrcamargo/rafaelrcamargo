> A inventive student of technology and computers.

### 📝 This is the place where I save my projects, so feel free to learn more:

I like solving problems and learning new things, tools, languages, and paradigms, I learn as needed. Always searching for a new excuse for coding it. 

- 📚 I'm currently working with **⚛ React Native | Next.js** & **Node.js | Prisma | tRPC** with **TypeScript**.
- 🌱 I'm ever studying, and not understanding bothers me. Math, functional programming, and PL performance are the topics for now.
- 🎉 And for fun I like:
  - Coding in **Rust**, is all about performance and safety, besides being cool.
  - And sketching in **Python** from plots to an automated YouTube channel and whatever else I'm feeling like... 👀\_
  - Oh and **Haskell**, I'm searching for an excuse to learn it. :D
- 💬 I also have some projects with **Arduino** in **C/C++**, and general *IOT stuff* & love to talk about it!
