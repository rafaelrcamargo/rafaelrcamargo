> An inventive student of technology & computers.

### 📝 This is where I keep my projects. Feel free to explore more:

I enjoy solving problems and learning new things, tools, languages, and more. I learn as needed, and I'm always looking for a new reason to code in { trending_coding_language }.

- 📚 I'm currently working with **⚛ React Native | Next.js** & **Node.js | Prisma | tRPC** using **TypeScript**.
- 🌱 I'm a lifelong learner, and nothing annoys me more than not understanding something.
  - 📖 Currently, I'm delving deep into math, scalable architecture, and language performance.
- 🎉 In my free time, I enjoy:
  - Coding in 🦀 **Rust**. It's all about safety, performance, and the best developer experience out there.
  - Creating sketches in **Python**, from plots to an [automated YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@trendinggoesbrrr), and whatever else I feel like... 👀
  - Oh, and I'm also participating in the **2022 AOC** (Advent of Code), but for each day, I choose a different language. It's been fun!
- 💬 I also work on IoT projects with **Arduino** & **C**! They might blow your mind, or maybe your fuse...

> **Note**: I've separated my favorite projects and pinned them below. Take a look!
